<h3>Babylon</h3>
    <p>It talks about the transition of the non talking cinema to sound cinema
        which was a total blast in Hoollywood an many actor couldn't even
        do a job for this kind of industry. </p>

<h3>Past Lives</h3>
    <p>It talks about ta love that couldn't be and why it's not 
        bad to let go. </p>

<h3>Maleficio</h3>
        <p>It's a horror movie that gathers all the scary stuff but
            in a really awesome way, it's the scariest movie I had seen </p>
